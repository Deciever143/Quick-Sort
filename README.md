# Quick-Sort
Definition and Implementation of Quick sort.

Quick-Sort: Quick-sort is a Divide and Conquer ALgorithm and it is a recursive algorithm. It works by choosing any element in the array as a n pivot and Divides the array by storing the elements less than or equal to pivot on its left and elements greater than pivot to its right. This is called partitioning. Now, we Conquer by recursively sorting the sub-array to the left and right of the pivot and combine them to get the sorted array.
